# music-player-system-mimic

For this project implementation we have chosen to mimic a music player system. Users will be allowed to create multiple playlists based on their mood. Users can pick songs from any of the created playlist and will be allowed to play the music file they have chosen.

Playlist will be created from the list of songs that is available. There will not be any playlist available for the user by default. Once the user logs in into the system, they can create their own playlist by adding available songs from the default list. Users are allowed to add or remove songs from their playlist at any point of time. Some of the features of the playlist are mentioned below:
- Creation of playlists
- Adding/removing a song in the playlist
- Shuffle option in the music player
- Play the playlist
- Sorting playlist based on the song name
